        Please provide **code** that reproduces the issue and whenever possible, an **image** that demonstrates the issue. Please upload images to GitHub, not to third-party file hosting sites. If necessary, add the image to a zip or tar archive.

        The best reproductions are self-contained scripts with minimal dependencies. If you are using a framework such as Plone, Django, or Buildout, try to replicate the issue just using Pillow.
